1. The Product declares the interface (abstract class), which is common to all objects 
	that can be produced by the creator and its subclasses.

public abstract class Mage : Unit

2. Concrete Products are different implementations of the product interface.

public class FireMage : Mage
public class IceMage : Mage

3. The Creator class declares the factory method that returns new product objects.
	You can declare the factory method as abstract
	public  class MageCreator {
		public virtual Mage CreateMage() {
			return new Mage("Name", 50, 50, 50);
		}
	}

4. Concrete Creators override the base factory method so it returns a different type of product.
	public class IceMageCreator : MageCreator
	{
		public override Mage CreateMage()
		{
			return new IceMage("IceMage", 50, 50, 50);
		}
	}
