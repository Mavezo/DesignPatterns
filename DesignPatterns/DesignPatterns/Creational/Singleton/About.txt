1. The Singleton class declares the static method get Instance 
	that returns the same instance of its own class.

	The Singleton’s constructor should be hidden from 
	the client code. Calling the getInstance 
	method should be the only way of getting the Singleton object.

		public class GameManager
		{
			private static readonly GameManager instance = new GameManager();
			public static GameManager Instance => instance;
			private GameManager() { }
			public int Score { get; set; }
		}
