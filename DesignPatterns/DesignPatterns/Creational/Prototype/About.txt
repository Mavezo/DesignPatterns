1. The Prototype interface declares the cloning methods. In most cases, it’s a single clone method.
	public interface IPrototype<T>
		{
			T Clone();
		}

2. The Concrete Prototype class implements the cloning method
	public abstract class Unit : IPrototype<Unit>{
		public abstract Unit Clone();
	}

3. The Client can produce a copy of any object that follows the prototype interface.
	Mage copy1 = mage1.Clone();
	Mage copy2 = new Mage(mage1);
